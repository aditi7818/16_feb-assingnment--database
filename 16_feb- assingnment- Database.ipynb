    "Questio: What is database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL database.\n",
    "Answer: \n",
    "Database: \n",
    "A database is an organized collected of data, so thart it can be easily accessed and managed.\n",
    "You can organize data into tables, rows, columns, and index it to make it easier to find relevant information.\n",
    "Database handlers create a data base in such a way that only see set of software program provides access of data to all the users.\n",
    "The main purpose of database is to opreate a large amount of information by storing, retrieving, and managing data.\n",
    "There are many dyanmic websites on the world wide web nowdays which are handled throgh database. For example, a model that checks the availability of rooms in a hotel. it is an \n",
    "example of dynamic webiste that uses a database.\n",
    "There are many databases available like MySQL, Sybase, Oracle, SQL Serve etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Main differences between NoSQL and SQL \n",
    "\n",
    "Type\n",
    "SQL database are primarily called Relational Database(RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called non-relational or distributed databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Language\n",
    "SQL database define and manipulate data-based structured query language(SQL). seeing from a side this language is extremly powerful. SQL is one of the most versatile and \n",
    "widely-used options availabe which makes it a safe choice, especially for great complex queries. But from another side, it can be restrictive. SQL requries you to use predeined \n",
    "schemas to determine the structure of your data before you work with it. Also, all of your data must follow the same structure. This can require significant up-front\n",
    "preparation which means that a change in the structure would be both difficult and disruptive to your whole system.\n",
    "A NoSQL database has a dynamic schema for unstructured data. Data is stored in many ways which means it can be document-oriented, column-oriented, graph-based, or organized as a \n",
    "key-value store. This flexibility means that documents can be created without having a defined structure first. Also, each document can have its own unique structure. The syntax \n",
    "varies from database to database, and you can add fields as you go.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability\n",
    "In almost all situations SQL database are vertically scalable. This means that you can increase the load on a single server by incerasing things like RAM, CPU or SSD. but on the \n",
    "other hand, NoSQL database are horizontally scalable. This means that you handle more traffic by sharding, or adding more serves in your NoSQL database. it is similar to adding more \n",
    "floors to the same building versus adding more buldings to the neighborhood. Thus NoSQL can ultimately become larger and more powerful, making these database the preferred choice \n",
    "for large or ever-changing data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure\n",
    "SQL database are table-based on the other hand NoSQl database are either key-value pairs, document-based graph databases, or wide-column stores. this makes relational SQL database a \n",
    "better option for applications that require multi-row transactions such as an accounting system or for legacy system that were built for a relational structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Property followed\n",
    "SQL database follow ACID properties(Atomicity, Conistency, Isolation, and Durability) whereas the NoSQL database follows the brewers CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability, and \n",
    "Partition tolerance).\n",
    "\n",
    "When to Use: SQL vs NoSQL\n",
    "SQL is a good choice when working with related data. Relational database are efficient, flexible, and easily accessed by any application. A benfiet of a relational database is that\n",
    "when one user updates a specific record, every instance of the database automatically refreshes, and that information is provided in real-time.\n",
    "SQL and a relational database make it easy to handle a great deal of information, scale as necessary and allow flexible access to data only needing to update data once instead of \n",
    "changing multiple files, for instance. it is also best assessing data integrity. since each piece of information is stored in a single place, there is no problem with former\n",
    "versions confusing the picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "while NoSQL is good when the avaliability of big data is more crucial, SQL is valued for ensuring data validity. it is also a wise decision when a business needs to expand in \n",
    "response to shifting customer demands. NoSQL offers high perfomance, flexibility and ease of use.\n",
    "NoSQL is also a wise choice when dealing with large or constantly changing data sets, flexible data models, or requirements that do not fit into a relational model. Document database\n",
